## Overview

### 🛡️ What is Securial?

<img align="right" width="400" height="400" alt="Securial Logo"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0950aba1-de3e-467d-a335-55f2fa47a8ac" />

**Securial** is a mountable Rails engine that provides robust, extensible authentication and access control for Rails applications. It supports:

- 🔑 JWT-based authentication
- ↪️ API session tokens, with refresh tokens
- 🤳 Simple integration with web and mobile apps
- 🧹 Clean, JSON-based API responses
- 🧍 User management with roles
- 🫙 Database-agnostic support

### 👀 Why Securial?

Securial was built to offer a clean, modular, and API-first authentication system for Rails developers who want full control without the black-box complexity. Whether you're building for the web, mobile, or both, Securial gives you the flexibility to implement exactly what you need — from simple JWT authentication to more advanced setups involving sessions, API tokens, and role-based access.

It follows familiar Rails conventions, stays lightweight and database-agnostic, and keeps security at the core. With fully customizable controllers, serializers, and logic, Securial is designed to grow with your project — making it an ideal choice for everything from side projects to production-grade APIs.

## 🚀 Installation

Securial can be installed on an existing Rails application or use the `securial new app_name` command to create a new Securial-ready Rails app.

### Installation on an existing Rails app:

Add Securial to an existing Rails app is as simple as 1..2..3:

- Add `gem "securial"` to your GemFile
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails generate securial:install`
- Mount the Securial engine in your Rails application `config/routes.rb` file:

  ```ruby
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    mount Securial::Engine => "/securial"

    # The rest of your routes
  end
  ```

- Run the migrations by running the command: `rails db:migrate`

💡 Full installation steps are available in the [Wiki › Installation](https://github.com/AlyBadawy/Securial/wiki/Installation).

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Securial** generates an initializer with sensible defaults and full control over logging, mailers, session settings, and roles.

For all configuration options and examples, refer to the [Wiki › Configuration](https://github.com/AlyBadawy/Securial/wiki/Configuration)

## 📦 Usage

After installation and mounting, **Securial** exposes endpoints like:

- GET /securial/status — Check service availability
- POST /securial/sessions — Sign in (JWT or session)
- DELETE /securial/sessions — Sign out
- GET /securial/accounts/cool_username — Get a user profile by username
- GET /securial/admins/roles — View roles

**Securial** returns consistent JSON API responses.
